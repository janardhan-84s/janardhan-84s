## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi there! I'm **Janardhan Rao Maroju**, a curious and enthusiastic **DevOps Engineer** with a knack for automation, containerization, and simplifying complex tech through clear communication.

🚀 With hands-on experience in tools like Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and AWS, I thrive on building robust, scalable infrastructure. My favorite playgrounds? Shell scripts, cloud-native deployments, and pipelines that just work.

🧠 I’m passionate about sharing knowledge — whether it’s through engaging blog posts, creative analogies, or helpful diagrams that make “aha!” moments happen.

💡 If it involves making tech more accessible, automating the boring stuff, or spreading DevSecOps best practices, count me in.

📚 Let’s connect and learn together. I believe tech should be human-friendly — and I’m here to prove it.
